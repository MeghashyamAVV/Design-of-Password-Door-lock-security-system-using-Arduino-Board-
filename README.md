# Design-of-Password-Door-lock-security-system-using-Arduino-Board

This project is a Password Security Lock System Using Arduino, Keypad & Servo. According to the requirement. Security is becoming a major concern these days as theft is on the rise. So digital password lock can easily secure your home or locker. It only opens your door when the correct password is entered. The circuit of this project is very simple which includes Arduino, keypad module, button, servo motor, and LCD. Arduino controls the entire process, such as taking the password from a keypad module, comparing passwords, changing passwords, turning the servo motor, and sending the status to the LCD display. The keypad is used to enter the password. The buzzer is used for indications. Similarly, the servo motor is used to open the gate when the motor is rotating and the LCD is used to display status or a message on it. The system comprises of a 4x4 keypad.
